# reactionTimeGame
This repository contains a Verilog program in the Quartus design software to code the digital logic DE10-LITE board.

The objective of this project is to design a reaction time game using the DE10-lite board and its components including the LEDs, switches, buttons, and 7-segment display.
The purpose of this design project was to design a reaction time game programmed in Verilog using Quartus to test the userâ€™s reflexes. The inputs are the buttons, switches, and the clock module. The outputs are the LEDs that blink and the 7-segment display for the timer.

Equipment/Peripherals:
- Quartus (Software)
- DE10-LITE Board (Hardware):
- On-board USB-Blaster
- LEDs
- 7-Segment Display
- Switches [SW0-SW9]
- Buttons [KEY0-KEY1]
